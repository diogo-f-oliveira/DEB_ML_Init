# DEB ML Init

## Reliable machine learning initialization methods for the calibration of Dynamic Energy Budget models

To obtain a DEB model, the calibration problem must be solved: find the parameters that minimize the deviation
between observed data and model predictions. While DEB model calibration is largely automated, the selection of initial 
parameters remains a key unresolved step, since the only automated method – the bijection method – often fails to 
produce a feasible initial parameter set. Consequently, modelers resort to trial-and-error to find parameters to seed
the estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose using machine learning to initialize the calibration. We develop two
models: a neural network and a 1-nearest-neighbor. Both models are built with a focus on feasibility, directly
integrating parameter constraints into their structure. 

This repository contains the code and notebooks used in the paper: 


This repository contains the code and notebooks used to build datasets from the Add‑my‑Pet (AmP) collection, 
train ML models that predict DEB parameters from commonly available zero‑variate data plus taxonomy/ecology, 
check feasibility, and compare against the bijection baseline. 
The repository also includes the DEBtool implementation of the algorithms and code to convert Python models to MATLAB models compatible with DEBtool.

## Usage

### Python

#### Neural Networks

The neural network models are implemented in PyTorch at:
- `project_code/algorithms/neural_networks.py`: contains the model definitions
- `project_code/algorithms/loss_functions.py`: contains the custom loss functions used to train the models
- `project_code/data/prepare_data_pytorch.py`: data loading and preprocessing scripts for PyTorch models

The scripts to train the model are in `project_code/train/`:
- `train_pytorch_model.py`: training script
- `calibrate_pytorch_model.py`: script to tune hyperparameters 



#### 1-Nearest-Neighbor
The taxonomy 1-NN models are implemented using scikit-learn at `project_code/algorithms/`:
- `project_code/algorithms/taxonomic_1nn.py`: contains the model definition
- `project_code/algorithms/build_sklearn_model.py`: contains helper functions to build and save the model
- `project_code/data/prepare_data_sklearn.py`: data loading and preprocessing scripts for scikit-learn models

### DEBtool

Make sure to download the latest available DEBtool version at https://github.com/add-my-pet/DEBtool_M/.
To run the InitNet initialization, the code in the directory `DEBtool M/lib/pet/DEBInitNet` must be added to the 
MATLAB path alongside the other DEBtool directories. Its usage is similar to other initialization methods in DEBtool. 
Simply choose option ’3’ as the pars init method:

```
estim_options(’pars_init_method’, 3);
```
